Roads Expenditure
================
The 2013 table contains figures for road improvements and maintenance.  Since road improvements are probably not carried out on an anual basis, these figures might not be useful.
I will look for figures for road maintenance without road improvements.

New table contains data for five years from 2009 to 2013.  With the addition of the four years, it might not be necessary to distinguish between expenditure towards improvement and maintenance.
